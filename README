Reproduce


1. condor_submit code/preprocess_eyegaze_recordings.submit
   - uses code/preprocess_eyegaze_recordings.py with the correct pixel2deg
     conversion factor to produce preprocessed timeseries data for each subject
     and run individually

   1. any signal loss longer than 20ms is nulled with 10ms pre/post padding
   2. x/y time series are filtered with an Savitzky-Golay filter by fitting
      linear function to sliding window of 9ms width
   3. after filtering, eye movement velocitiy and accelration time series
      are computed from the filtered data

2. condor_submit code/detect_events.submit

   - parameter: max average velocity of fixation (if a non-saccade exceeds this,
                it will nevertheless not be considered as a fixation)

   - parameter: hard (adaptive) and soft (0.3*hard) saccade threshold

   - parameter: bunch of "magic" numbers in the saccade detection threshold handling

   - parameter: min saccade length set to 9ms

   - parameter: post-saccade window to look for glissades (40ms)

   - parameter: max signal loss in glissade window (10ms)

   - parameter: max signal loss in fixation window (10ms)

   - parameter: max total amplitude of fixation windows (2deg)

   - use code/detect_events.py to perform saccade/glissade/fixation detection
     using a semi-adaptive algorithm per subject per run individually
